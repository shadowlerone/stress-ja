	<span class="header">Who are we?</span><br />
	We are a business created by 11<sup>th</sup> grade entrepreneurs with the help of JA Quebec, an
	organization that encourages teens to start their own business.
	We know that stress is everywhere in the world.
	From a very young age, we are afraid or we are worried about something.
	As students, we know how stressful it is to have big exams, and we can not even
	imagine the level of stress adults go through routinely.
	That's why we make stress balls to calm people down and at least be a little more peaceful.
